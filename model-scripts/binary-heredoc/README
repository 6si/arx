The file ./raw contains all two byte sequences and ./all-byte-pairs.sh is a
shell script with all such sequences encoded in a HERE document, along with a
decoder.

Run it to capture the output for comparison:

 :; ./all-byte-pairs.sh > output

Use ./xxdiff.bash to get a hex diff of ./raw and the output, byte by byte:

 :; ./xxdiff.bash ./raw ./output

There should be no difference.
